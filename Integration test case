Integration testing verifies the interactions between different modules or components of a software system to ensure they work together correctly. Here's an example of a test case for integration testing:

Test Case: Integration Testing for User Authentication System
Objective:
To verify that the user authentication system integrates correctly with the database and user interface components.

Preconditions:
The user authentication system is deployed and accessible.
The database is properly configured with test data.
The user interface components are functional.
Test Steps:
Verify User Authentication:

Input valid username and password.
Click the "Login" button.
Verify that the user is successfully authenticated and directed to the home page.
Verify Invalid Credentials Handling:
